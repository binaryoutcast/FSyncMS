FSyncMS
=======

PHP Sync Server for Firefox/Pale Moon Sync
An extension of the Weave-Minimal Server.

More information about the original implementation of this server, past versions, etc.
can be found here:

https://www.ohnekontur.de/category/technik/sync/fsyncms/

Although the original author has planned further extensions to this implementation,
the current state of this server implementation is rather stagnant and missing two
important features:
* Delete account from the web
* Reset password from the web (similar to reset inside the client)

Current state is the state as-used by the Pale Moon Sync service, which is v0.16.

If you wish to help complete the missing features, please feel free to clone this repository and make 
the necessary edits -- kindly submit a pull request after you've tested your changes so it can be merged
back in and improve this software!

Password Change Bug-fix

There has been a bug in FSyncMS v 0.13: if you tried to update your password via Firefox, the wrong hash
was written in the Database. As a result the account was no longer usable, but no data should be lost.
This update fixes the Bug.
